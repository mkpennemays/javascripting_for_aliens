# javascripting_for_aliens

Okay, I took some liberties with this project. I found a similar dataset on Kaggle. Using python in a Jupyter notebook, I cleaned and reduced the dataset. It was really too large to use on clientside only. I created a datafile in a similar format to the one provided.

Because latitude and longitude were included in this dataset, I decided to map the sightings. I selected to map all cities that had 10 or more reported sightings. I added the number of sightings to each map point. Just for fun. 

Multiple filters are included, and I added a display of the number of records returned in the filtered dataset. Also included a 'clear filters' button.
